# 🌱 Automatic Greenhouse IoT

This project aims to create an automated greenhouse using IoT technology for monitoring and controlling environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and light. The system will enable cultivation automation, ensuring better conditions for plant development.

## 📋 Description

The Automatic Greenhouse is equipped with sensors and actuators that communicate with an IoT platform. The automation includes:

- Continuous monitoring of air temperature, humidity, and soil moisture.
- Automatic control of lighting, ventilation, and irrigation.
- User interface for real-time monitoring and manual adjustments when necessary.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **IoT Platform**: Arduino, ESP32
- **Programming Language**: C++
- **Sensors**: DHT22, soil moisture sensor, LDR
- **Actuators**: Relays to control lights, water pumps, and fans.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. **Setup in Tinkercad**: Open Autodesk Tinkercad and create a new circuit project.
2. **Add Components**: Drag and drop the sensors and actuators needed for the greenhouse (temperature sensor, soil moisture sensor, relays, etc.) onto the Tinkercad workspace.
3. **Upload the Code**: Paste the project code directly into the Tinkercad code editor.
4. **Simulation and Control**: Run the simulation to monitor and control the greenhouse's operation in real time.
